/**
 *
 * @author Julian and Dylan
 *
 * for one bonus
 *     change the code a little bit
 *
 *First question: 
 *How much does the average store make?
 *    
 *Bonuses:
 *What is the best month to open the store?
 *	- Start at each month and see the overall profit (do this with a for loop)
 *	- Use a while loop to run the 12 year process 25 times and each time that month is the best add it to the count
 *	- Determine the best year overall to start the shop by seeing which was the best to start the most.
 *Include deterioration of hardware
 *Add different tiers of employees
 *	Once a certain amount of money is made add more cashiers and buristas
 *Depending on the number of buristas/cashiers change how many customers the store can have per day
 *Add rent per month 
 *
 *ToDo:
 *offer discounts
 *	- increasing popularity while decreasing prices
 *	- what is the margin for decrease to maximizes profits
 *
